#Gametime DTR

###What are your learning goals for this project?

Brett: I really want to get more comfortable with object prototypes during this project.

David: We took a quick look at canvas a few weeks ago, but I'm looking forward to going a little more in-depth and to get a better sense for how it works.

###What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?

Brett: I haven't really decided if I prefer pair-programming or divide and conquer, but I imagine we'll be pairing a lot early on until we get a better feel for everything.

David: I prefer pairing at this point.

###How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?

Brett: I'm a fan of informal in-person communication

David: I'd rather just get together and talk than bother with Slack or email.

###How would you describe your work style?

Brett: I'm pretty stubborn and tend to just ram my head into a problem until I solve it.

David: I tend to be an analytical problem-solver.

###Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?

Brett: I have, at points, failed to let myself be persuaded that approaches different than mine are feasible.

David: I've had several projects with poor JavaScript organization and want to improve on it.

###What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?

Brett: I do my best work in the morning. I also prefer to have a partner/team that can laugh at me/themselves.

David: I definitely work best with someone that's willing to try stuff without worrying about messing up.

###What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?

Brett: I've got full availability.

David: I don't have any scheduling constraints.

###What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?

Brett: I'd rather give feedback informally and in person. Sometimes I catch myself softening my feedback or glossing over some difficulties to avoid hurt feelings.

David: I'd rather focus on positive feedback than negative.

###What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project?

Brett: I'm fairly comfortable going to outside sources (Google, StackOverflow, etc...) to solve unfamiliar problems.

David: I think I've got a relatively good handle on basic JavaScript and DOM manipulation at this point.

###Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?

Brett: I'm not feeling great about my CSS skills. I'd really like to take the lead on any CSS problems that pop up for us.

David: I'm feeling pretty hazy about Canvas, so I'd definitely like to focus on that in this project.

###What tools do you want to use to manage the project?

Brett: I have no preference. We could use Waffle or Trello or we could just communicate with Slack and our faces.

David: I'm open to anything. I think frequency of communication is more important than the medium.

###How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?

Brett: I guess I hope we'll conquer those issues together?

David: With teamwork.

###How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?

Brett: If we hit all the functionality specs and I understand how we did it, which means that I'd appreciate patience with me if I need to be walked through how you did something a couple of times.

David: Getting through all the functionality specs and knowing what everything we wrote does. If we divide and conquer, we should still communicate about how/why we're doing stuff.
